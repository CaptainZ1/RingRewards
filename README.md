# Welcome to Ring Rewards!

This app is for my Ring Rewards Project. This app pairs with a electronically controlled candy dispenser to only allow the user candy if they have met their
fitness goal(s). Currently the project requires the use of Apple Health and a paired Apple Watch. It uses the data from the user's "activity rings" to determine if 
candy can be dispensed.
